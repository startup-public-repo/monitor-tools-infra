# 📊 Monitoring Tools Infrastructure Setup  

## Overview  

This repository contains **Terraform** and **Ansible** configurations for setting up a scalable **monitoring infrastructure** in AWS. It automates the deployment and configuration of **Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack**, ensuring efficient system monitoring, logging, and visualization.  

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform  
✅ **Automated provisioning** with Ansible  
✅ **AWS Route 53 DNS configuration** for service access  
✅ **Secure IAM roles and policies** for access control  
✅ **High availability and scalability** setup  

## 📦 Components  

### 1️⃣ **Terraform Configuration**  
- **Creates EC2 instances** for monitoring tools  
- **Sets up networking** (VPC, subnets, security groups)  
- **Configures Route 53 DNS** for service accessibility  

### 2️⃣ **Ansible Playbooks**  
- **Installs and configures Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack**  
- **Defines user roles and permissions**  
- **Automates monitoring tools setup**  

## 🏗️ Deployment Steps  

### Prerequisites  
- AWS account with necessary permissions  
- Terraform & Ansible installed locally  
- Access to a Git repository for configurations  

### Steps  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/monitoring-tools-infra.git
   cd monitoring-tools-infra
   ```  
2. Initialize Terraform:  
   ```bash
   terraform init  
   terraform apply -auto-approve  
   ```  
3. Run Ansible playbooks:  
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook setup-monitoring.yml  
   ```  

## 📊 Monitoring Setup Details  

🔹 **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics for system monitoring  
🔹 **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics with custom dashboards  
🔹 **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Aggregates and analyzes logs  

## 🔒 Security Best Practices  

⚡ **IAM Role-based Access**: Ensure limited access to monitoring tools  
⚡ **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Secures communication between services  
⚡ **Network Access Controls**: Restrict access via security groups
