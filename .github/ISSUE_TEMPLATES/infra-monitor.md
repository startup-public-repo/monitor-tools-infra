## Description

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want to** set up monitoring tools including Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack  
**So that** I can efficiently monitor, analyze, and visualize system performance and logs.

## Requirements

1. **Server Setup**:
   - **Operating System**: RHEL or Ubuntu image on AWS.
   - **Instance Type**: [e.g., t3.medium]
   - **Storage and Networking**:
     - Storage Size: 100GB.
     - VPC Configuration with private and public subnets.

2. **Monitoring Tools Deployment**:
   - **Prometheus** for system monitoring.
   - **Grafana** for visualization and dashboarding.
   - **ELK Stack** for log aggregation and search.
   - Configured for high availability and scalability.

3. **AWS Route 53 DNS Setup**:
   - Custom domain mapping for services.
   - Secure and optimized DNS configurations.

4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - **Terraform** to automate AWS infrastructure deployment.
   - **Ansible** for provisioning and configuring monitoring tools.

5. **Security & Access Management**:
   - IAM roles and policies for access control.
   - SSL certificates for secure access.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy AWS EC2 instances using Terraform.
2. Configure Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack using Ansible.
3. Set up Route 53 DNS entries for services.
4. Test monitoring dashboards and logging functionality.

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional and automated monitoring system setup using Terraform and Ansible, deployed in AWS with DNS routing.

## Actual Outcome

_Provide details if there are any issues or deviations after setup._

## Additional Context

- Dependencies: Ensure IAM roles and policies are configured correctly.
- Potential challenges: Service connectivity issues, scaling bottlenecks.
